- 👋 Hi, I’m Gaurav Madhav Pai. I work as a Research Volunteer at University at Buffalo. My work in mainly in Bioinformatics, learning to use Computer Vision algorithms on Chest X-rays to diagnose various respiratory infections. I am a Recent Graduate from University at Buffalo (MS in CS). I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.


- 👀 I’m interested in the field of Data Engineering. I love working with Big Data. Working with companies to design and organize their Data Ecosystem is something that I feel will be immensly worthy of the time I have on this planet. _I suspect this drive comes out from me being a little bit of a real-life neat-freak like Monica(from the famous TV show Friends)_. 

I am also fascinated by Distributed Systems.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build ETL pipelines for Real Time Data Streams using tools like Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.
