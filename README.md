👋 Hi, I’m Gaurav Madhav Pai. 
- I am a Recent Graduate from University at Buffalo (MS in CS). 
- I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
- I work as a Research Volunteer at University at Buffalo. My work is focused on learning to use Computer Vision algorithms on Chest X-rays to diagnose various respiratory infections. 

***

👀 I’m interested in the field of Data Engineering. 
- I love working with Big Data. 
- Working with companies to design, organize, automate and maintain their Data Ecosystem in this day and age, is something that I feel will be immensly worthy of the little time one has on this planet. <font size="0.5">_I suspect this drive comes from me being a little bit of a real-life neat-freak like Monica Geller (from TV show Friends, ofcourse!)_.</font>

🌱 I’m currently learning how to build ETL pipelines for Real Time Data Streams using tools like Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.
